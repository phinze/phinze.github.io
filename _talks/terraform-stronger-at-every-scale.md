Delivered as HashiConf EU 2019 Day 2 Keynote.

## Abstract

The #1 question HashiCorp gets about Terraform is: How do we scale? Terraform makes infrastructure easy to scale, but Terraform itself can be difficult to scale without the right features.

Learn how Terraform 0.12, Terraform Cloud, and Terraform Enterprise are bringing features that make scaling Terraform easier at each stage, from individuals to teams, and finally in large enterprises.
