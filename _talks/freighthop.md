A lightning talk I gave at WindyCityRails introducing
[Freighthop](https://github.com/phinze/freighthop/), a tool I was working on
for making Vagrant development easier that never quite got off the ground.
Looking back on it, I think you could classify it as an early predecessor to
[Otto](https://www.ottoproject.io/).
