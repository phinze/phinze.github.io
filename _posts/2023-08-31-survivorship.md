This is the third (and maybe last?!) in a series of posts on my experience with acute promyelocytic leukemia.

I've been meaning to write this for a long time, mainly because it's ominous to leave two posts about blood cancer on your blog and then go silent after the treatment one. I've tried and failed several times over the last few years to draft something. I'm going to try and talk about that writing difficulty in a bit.

But first let's get the good news out there: **my treatment was successful**! In March of 2021 I had my bone marrow checked for naughty cells and none were found. The chance of APL relapse after this treatment is very low - about as low as you can get for cancer. Aside from a few extra tests I've gone back to pretty much normal medical care. Pretty amazing right?!

Ok so why was that so hard for me to write and post on the same website where I wrote about my diagnosis and treatment?

I think part of it it has to do with being wary of giving "my cancer story" a beginning, middle, and end. I'll admit there's a smidge of superstition in there, but it's also much harder to write about epistemic ambiguity than it is to write "all clear, the end, happily ever after!"

Here's the thing: oncologists really [don't like the term "cured."] My doctors explained to me that instead of a binary cured/not cured, they prefer to speak in more statistically rigorous terms. The term of art (er, science) is ["disease-free survival"] or more generally "survival rate." This freaked me out the first time I read it. *Oh great so now we just start a timer to see how long it takes until I die.*

It's essentially an application of the classic adage of logic: “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." {%- sidenote "fitting" "It's fitting that attempts to [attribute this adage to an original citation] produce unclear results." %} Or even more essentially: we don't fully understand exactly what causes most (all?) cancers. Not only that, we also [don't understand exactly _why_ many of the drugs we use work]. I found this a mind boggling revelation when I first learned it, but its comes down to the way medical science works. {%- sidenote "ithink" "According to my very, very amateur understanding at least. If you see something off please correct me!" %}

* The scientific method is all about what you can observe.
* The human body is an incredibly complex system of systems, so it's not straightforward to apply a drug and “see what it does" on a global scale. You have to choose what to observe.
* And your observations are constrained by the fact that the object of observation is an alive human that you're trying to help. That means you can't just have somebody swallow a pill and then chop them up to see what happened in all their organs.
 
So putting this together, the focus of drug studies tends to looks like this:

* Identify substance you think might help with disease.
* Get group of people with disease.
* Give some of that group the substance.
* See if those who gets substance have better outcomes than those who didn't.


The massive body of medical and scientific study around cancer and its treatment is largely based on statistical correlates.

You say “cured" when there's a problem that's well understood and you can be sure when you've solved it.

Epistemic uncertainty
