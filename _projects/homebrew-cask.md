A CLI workflow for managing macOS GUI applications, created in 2012. Homebrew Cask extends the popular Homebrew package manager to handle installation of desktop applications like Google Chrome, Slack, and thousands of other Mac apps through simple command-line operations.

I created the project to solve the problem of managing Mac applications that didn't fit into Homebrew's traditional Unix-style package model. Over time, I handed over maintainership to the broader Homebrew community, where it continues to thrive as one of the most popular ways to install Mac software.
